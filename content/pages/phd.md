Title:PhD

In September 2013, I started my PhD in applied mathematics at Inria and at the Université de Grenoble. 
I was supervised by [Florence FORBES](http://mistis.inrialpes.fr/people/forbes/) at [Inria Grenoble Rhône-Alpes](https://www.inria.fr/centre/grenoble), [Mistis](https://mistis.inrialpes.fr/) team, 
and by [Philippe CIUCIU](https://sites.google.com/site/philippeciuciu/) at [Inria Saclay Île-de-France](https://www.inria.fr/centre/saclay) [Parietal](https://team.inria.fr/parietal/research/) team, at CEA/Neurospin. 
I was also part of the Laboratoire Jean Kuntzmann.
I graduated in December 2016.

Here you can find my [PhD manuscript](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01440495/document) and the slides used in my [PhD defense](./../files/PhD_slides_AFrauPascual.pdf).

I worked on Bayesian methods for the analysis of BOLD and ASL functional MRI data. I was particularly interested in the study of the hemodynamic and perfusion responses due to evoked activity and in the potential clinical biomarkers that could derive from the study of these two fMRI modalities.
