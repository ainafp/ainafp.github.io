Title:PhD

From September 2013 to December 2016, I did my PhD in applied mathematics at Inria and at the Grenoble-Alpes University. 
I was supervised by [Florence FORBES](http://mistis.inrialpes.fr/people/forbes/) at [Inria Grenoble Rhône-Alpes](https://www.inria.fr/centre/grenoble), [Mistis (now Statify)](https://team.inria.fr/statify/) team, 
and by [Philippe CIUCIU](https://sites.google.com/site/philippeciuciu/) at [Inria Saclay Île-de-France](https://www.inria.fr/centre/saclay) [Parietal](https://team.inria.fr/parietal/research/) team, at CEA/Neurospin. I worked on Bayesian methods for the analysis of BOLD and ASL functional MRI data. I was particularly interested in the study of the hemodynamic and perfusion responses due to evoked activity and in the potential clinical biomarkers that could derive from the study of these two fMRI modalities.

Here you can find my [PhD manuscript](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01440495/document) and the slides used in my [PhD defense](./../files/PhD_slides_AFrauPascual.pdf).
