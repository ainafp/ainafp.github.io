I am currently a Research Fellow at the Massachusetts General Hospital and at Harvard Medical School, in Boston (USA). 
For the past two years, as part of the [Laboratory of Computational Neuroimaging](https://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/lab/lcn), 
I have worked with [Iman Aganj](http://nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/~iman/) and [Bruce Fischl](https://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/lab/lcn/people#bf) 
on the development of methods for the analysis of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data to study how the brain is connected, 
physically looking at tissue structure with diffusion MRI and 
functionally looking at patterns of synchronous activity with functional MRI. I have also worked in collaboration with several medical doctors, and participated in data acquisition. 

From September 2013 to December 2016, I did my PhD in applied mathematics at Inria, France.
I worked on the development of statistical models for the detection of brain activity from two different functional MRI modalities. 
You can read more about it [here](https://ainafp.github.io/pages/phd.html).

Before arriving to France, I studied Engineering in Telecommunication at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC) and at the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB). 
In 2012, I did a master at the ENS Cachan in applied mathematics, vision and machine learning, which lead me to my PhD research topic.
