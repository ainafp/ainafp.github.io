I am currently a Research Fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital and at Harvard Medical School, in Boston (USA). 
As part of the [Laboratory of Computational Neuroimaging](https://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/lab/lcn), I have worked with [Iman Aganj](http://nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/~iman/) and [Bruce Fischl](https://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/lab/lcn/people#bf) on the development of methods for diffusion and functional MRI data analysis to study brain connectivity.

I did my PhD in applied mathematics at the Université de Grenoble, supervised by [Florence FORBES](http://mistis.inrialpes.fr/people/forbes/) at [Inria Grenoble Rhône-Alpes](https://www.inria.fr/centre/grenoble), [Mistis](https://mistis.inrialpes.fr/) team, and by [Philippe CIUCIU](https://sites.google.com/site/philippeciuciu/) at [Inria Saclay Île-de-France](https://www.inria.fr/centre/saclay) [Parietal](https://team.inria.fr/parietal/research/) team, at CEA/Neurospin. I am also part of the Laboratoire Jean Kuntzmann.

During my PhD I have worked on Bayesian methods for the analysis of BOLD and ASL functional MRI data. I am particularly interested in the study of the hemodynamic and perfusion responses due to evoked activity and in the potential clinical biomarkers that can derive from the study of these two fMRI modalities. 

Before arriving to France, I studied Engineering in Telecommunication at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC) and at the University 
of the Balearic Islands (UIB). 
During my first masters degree project in Barcelona, I developed strategies to discriminate plausible from non-­plausible fiber tracts in diffusion MRI tractography using machine learning methods. In 2012, I did a master at the ENS Cachan in applied mathematics, vision and machine learning, which lead me to my current research topic.
