I am currently a Research Fellow at the Massachusetts General Hospital and at Harvard Medical School, in Boston (USA). 
For the past two years, as part of the [Laboratory of Computational Neuroimaging](https://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/lab/lcn), I have worked with [Iman Aganj](http://nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/~iman/) and [Bruce Fischl](https://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/lab/lcn/people#bf) on the development of methods to study how the brain is connected. 
We can look at brain connections in different ways by using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):
with diffusion MRI we model physical connections because this modality is sensitive to the tissue structure; 
with functional MRI we look at which brain regions are working synchronously and therefore are considered connected.
My work consisted in finding new ways of interpreting this data in order to provide useful information in the study of the brain in disease.

In December 2016, I finished my PhD in applied mathematics at Inria and at the Université de Grenoble, 
supervised by [Florence Forbes](http://mistis.inrialpes.fr/people/forbes/) at [Inria Grenoble Rhône-Alpes](https://www.inria.fr/centre/grenoble), [Mistis](https://mistis.inrialpes.fr/) team, 
and by [Philippe Ciuciu](https://sites.google.com/site/philippeciuciu/) at [Inria Saclay Île-de-France](https://www.inria.fr/centre/saclay) [Parietal](https://team.inria.fr/parietal/research/) team, at CEA/Neurospin. 
I was also part of the Laboratoire Jean Kuntzmann. 
During my PhD I worked on Bayesian methods for the analysis of BOLD and ASL functional MRI data. 
These are two functional MRI modalities that look at blood oxygenation changes that occurr in a certain brain region when it is active.
I specifically looked at the changes that are related to certain tasks performed during the scanning.
My work focused on the development of statistical models that helped us in the detection of brain activity with higher specificity.

Before arriving to France, I studied Engineering in Telecommunication at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC) and at the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB). 
In 2012, I did a master at the ENS Cachan in applied mathematics, vision and machine learning, which lead me to my PhD research topic.
