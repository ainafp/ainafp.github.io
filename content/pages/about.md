I am a research/data scientist with an interest in signal processing, machine learning and data analysis. I am especially interested in topics that have an impact in society (e.g. healthcare).
Most of my experience comes from doing brain imaging research in an academic environment, and I recently made a leap into the start-up world to work on physiological signal processing and other interesting problems a bit closer to the application.

Until November 2021, I was a Research Fellow at the Massachusetts General Hospital and at Harvard Medical School, in Boston (USA). 
As part of the [Laboratory of Computational Neuroimaging](https://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/lab/lcn) for almost 5 years, I worked on the development of methods for the analysis of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data to study how the brain is connected, 
physically looking at tissue structure with diffusion MRI and 
functionally looking at patterns of synchronous activity with functional MRI.

From September 2013 to December 2016, I did my PhD in applied mathematics at Inria, France.
I worked on the development of statistical models for the detection of brain activity from two different functional MRI modalities. 
You can read more about it [here](https://ainafp.github.io/pages/phd.html).

Before arriving to France, I studied Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of the Balearic Islands and at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC), BSc and MSc respectively. 
In 2012, I did a master of science (MSc) at the ENS Cachan in applied mathematics, vision and machine learning, which lead me to my PhD research topic.
