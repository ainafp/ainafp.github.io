I am currently a Research Fellow at the Massachusetts General Hospital and at Harvard Medical School, in Boston (USA). 
For the past two years, as part of the [Laboratory of Computational Neuroimaging](https://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/lab/lcn), I have worked with [Iman Aganj](http://nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/~iman/) and [Bruce Fischl](https://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/lab/lcn/people#bf) on the development of methods for diffusion and functional MRI data analysis to study brain connectivity.

In December 2016, I finsihed my PhD in applied mathematics at Inria and at the Université de Grenoble, supervised by [Florence FORBES](http://mistis.inrialpes.fr/people/forbes/) at [Inria Grenoble Rhône-Alpes](https://www.inria.fr/centre/grenoble), [Mistis](https://mistis.inrialpes.fr/) team, and by [Philippe CIUCIU](https://sites.google.com/site/philippeciuciu/) at [Inria Saclay Île-de-France](https://www.inria.fr/centre/saclay) [Parietal](https://team.inria.fr/parietal/research/) team, at CEA/Neurospin. I was also part of the Laboratoire Jean Kuntzmann. 
During my PhD I worked on Bayesian methods for the analysis of BOLD and ASL functional MRI data.  

Before arriving to France, I studied Engineering in Telecommunication at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC) and at the University 
of the Balearic Islands (UIB). 
In 2012, I did a master at the ENS Cachan in applied mathematics, vision and machine learning, which lead me to my PhD research topic.
