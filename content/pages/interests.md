Title:Interests

Some of my interests in research include:
Biomedical Image Processing and Analysis, Bayesian Models, Machine Learning, neuroimaging, functional and diffusion MRI.
I care very much about things being useful, and for that reason I make my codes public in [github.com/ainafp](https://github.com/ainafp)
