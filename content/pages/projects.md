Title:Projects

7T FMRI PROJECT (2019 - Present) 
MGH/HMS, Boston, MA
Acquisition of functional MRI data in the 7T scanner and analysis of the data to find differences between subjects with cerebral amyloid angiopathy and healthy subjects.

GLOBAL QUANTIFICATION OF STRUCTURAL CONNECTIVITY VIA A CONDUCTANCE MODEL (2018 - Present) 
MGH/HMS, Boston, MA
Development of a global method that quantifies structural brain connectivity derived from diffusion MRI, with the use of a conductance model. Detecting structural brain connectivity differences in disease.

STATISTICAL MODELS FOR FMRI (2013-2016) 
Inria, Paris, France
Statistical Models for the coupling of ASL and BOLD Magnetic Resonance modalities to study brain function and disease.
-Creation of a parcellation of the brain based on hemodynamic features extracted from BOLD fMRI.
-Physiologically informed Bayesian analysis of ASL fMRI data.
-Physiological models comparison for the analysis of ASL FMRI data.
-Stochastic and Variational Solutions to ASL fMRI Data Analysis.

GP FOR FMRI ANALYSIS (2016)
CEA Neurospin, Inria-Saclay, France 
Development of a non-parametric joint estimation method for functional MRI task activation values and the hemodynamic response function (HRF).
The HRF was modeled as a Gaussian Process, making continuous evaluation possible.
