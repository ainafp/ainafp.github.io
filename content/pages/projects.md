##7T FMRI PROJECT (2019 - Present) 
*MGH/HMS, Boston, MA*

Acquisition of functional MRI data in the 7T scanner and analysis of the data to find differences between subjects with cerebral amyloid angiopathy and healthy subjects.

##GLOBAL QUANTIFICATION OF STRUCTURAL CONNECTIVITY VIA A CONDUCTANCE MODEL (2018 - Present) 
*MGH/HMS, Boston, MA*

Development of a global method that quantifies structural brain connectivity derived from diffusion MRI, with the use of a conductance model. Detecting structural brain connectivity differences in disease. Here you can find the [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053811919300333?via%3Dihub) and [code](https://www.nitrc.org/projects/conductance).

##STATISTICAL MODELS FOR FMRI (2013-2016) 
*Inria, Paris, France*

Statistical Models for the coupling of ASL and BOLD Magnetic Resonance modalities to study brain function and disease. 
It included: 
the creation of a [parcellation of the brain based on hemodynamic features extracted from BOLD fMRI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.01121.pdf);
the [inclusion of a physiological prior to inform a Bayesian analysis of ASL fMRI data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.01133.pdf);
the [comparison of multiple physiological models and parameters in the analysis of ASL fMRI data](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01249014/file/14isbi_af_ff_pc.pdf);
and the development of [stochastic and variational solutions to ASL fMRI data analysis](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01249018/document). 
Codes are available at [pyhrf.github.io](https://pyhrf.github.io/)

##GP FOR FMRI ANALYSIS (2016)
*CEA Neurospin, Inria-Saclay, France*

Development of a [non-parametric joint estimation method for functional MRI task activation values and the hemodynamic response function (HRF)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09762).
The HRF was modeled as a Gaussian Process, making continuous evaluation possible.
